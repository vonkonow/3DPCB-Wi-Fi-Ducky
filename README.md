# 3DPCB-Wi-Fi-Ducky
This is a 3D printed Wi-Fi version of the well-known USB Rubber Ducky hacking device (featured in Mr Robot). It is a very powerful PEN test tool that bypasses common security protections since it is planted inside the network (requires some social engineering). I want to raise the awareness of this attack vector and encourage anyone to build it, test it and use it for good to improve security (white hat hacking): https://vonkonow.com/wordpress/3dpcb-wi-fi-ducky/

This implementation uses a 3D printed circuit board that provides the following benefits:
* Quick and easy to build. (takes minutes to assemble)
* Using standard components that can be found at your local supplier. (or in your drawer)
* low cost (< $9) allows you to install several expendable units. (spray and pray) 
* No need to wait for PCB delivery.
* Integrates the structure of the device.
* Compact since it stacks components in 3D. (44x30x11mm)

It’s neither good nor bad. Use it to do good, to study, and to test. Never use it to do harm or create damage!”
